<br>
<pre>Moisturizers are emulsions of oil and water (plus other ingredients for nourishing, treatment, and 
preserving) that help replenish hydration, keeping moisture in the skin and dryness out. Also, moisturizers
improve skin hydration and increase stratum corneum water content by directly providing water to the skin 
from their water phase and increasing occlusion to reduce trans-epidermal water loss, it also covers small 
skin fissures, provides a soothing protective film and protects the skin from friction.

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  Face serums are lightweight moisturizers that contain a higher concentration of active ingredients 
(such as hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, and vitamin C) than typical facial moisturizers. Known for 
their effectiveness, face serums are often used to manage specific skincare concerns, such as wrinkles. 
A serum will also typically be thinner than a moisturizer, which makes them perfect for layering. 
Serums can come in a variety of different formulas, including gels, oils, and light creams, and they can 
even have a water-like consistency in some cases.

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  Essences are considered to be the heart of the Korean skin-care routine and are meant to provide 
a layer of hydration and soften the skin. Facial essence is a lightweight, hydrating liquid that is 
used to prepare the skin to absorb moisturizer and subsequent products better. The essence is a concentrated 
formula that specifically targets wrinkles, fine lines, and dull and uneven skin tones. The main ingredient 
is yeast, which helps restore vital balance by promoting the skin's natural 28-day surface renewal process.

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  A toner is used to complete the cleansing of the skin, effectively removing impurities that remain 
after washing your face. Toners are effective at balancing the skin's pH level, which can help your 
skin to be less prone to oiliness and infection, and creating a more vibrant and smoother appearance. 
Toning helps to calm and balance the skin and prepare it for your next important step – applying a 
night cream or moisturizer. Toners were used as a way to balance the pH of the skin after using an 
alkaline soap product for cleansing

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other
 types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and prevent skin conditions such as acne. 
They may also contain moisturizers to prevent the skin from drying out. Cleansers leave the skin feeling 
clean and fresh. Facial cleansers come in different forms, and it’s helpful to choose the one that best works 
for your skin type and your lifestyle. Cleanser can be anything from “micellar waters, foaming gels, creams, 
balms, oils to wipes”

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  Facial scrubs are a good way of removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin. Exfoliating your 
skin can also prevent clogged pores and boost circulation and collagen production. Facial scrubs are easy to 
make at home and don't require many ingredients. Exfoliating is the process of removing dead skin cells from 
the surface of your skin using a chemical, granular substance, or exfoliation tool.

<br>
<font face="arial" font size="5%">
  <pre>
  Sheet masks are face-shaped sheet fabrics soaked in a nutrition-packed solution called serum. The sheet
 is made up of a variety of materials including papers, fibers, or gel types. These sheet masks are different
 from facial masks (paste type) that you only need to apply, take off or pat in extra serum instead of washing 
the paste after applying and putting on other skincare products. The sheet mask is generally used once and it
 is individually packaged, making them fast, convenient, and easy to use.

  Sunscreens are used to protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun. They help to prevent sunburn 
and premature aging (such as wrinkles, leathery skin). Sunscreen works by combining organic and inorganic active 
ingredients that protect the skin against the sun's rays.
